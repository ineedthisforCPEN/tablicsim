# Tablić Simulator
[Tablić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablanette#Tabli%C4%87) is a card game I
grew up with. I thought it would be a fun project to try to simulate different
players to see what strategies (or combinations of strategies) work best.
Originally, I approached this fully STEM-brained and thought that it would help
me discover the best strategy to play at all times. Realistically, I don't
expect this to be the case - instead I'm just going to use this as a chance to
mess around with Python and learn a couple things along the way.
